# InfoSec Analyzer

`InfoSec Analyzer` is a Python-based tool designed to scan files for potential security threats based on predefined patterns. The tool loads patterns from a file and then scans input files to check for these patterns. A report is generated based on the matches found.

## Features:
- Load security patterns from a predefined file (`patterns.txt`).
- Scan input files for potential threats based on loaded patterns.
- Generate a detailed report of findings.

## Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x

## Setup:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd InfoSecAnalyzer
    ```

## Usage:
Run the tool using:
```bash
python infosec_analyzer.py <input_file>
```
Replace `<input_file>` with the path to the file you want to scan.

## Adding New Patterns:
To add new security patterns, simply append them to the `patterns.txt` file.

## Note:
This tool is intended for educational purposes and serves as a basic example of a pattern scanning tool. It may not detect all threats and is not a replacement for professional security scanning tools.
